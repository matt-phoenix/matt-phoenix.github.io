Collaborating with others is difficult. All of the people involved need good communication, scheduling, and a workspace. However, what might be the most important thing are ground rules. There needs to be a mutual understanding between people or else there won't be effective communication and collaboration. This might be even more important for programmers. Programmers use many different languages. How would one project be able to incorporate them all? That's why coding standards are a thing. Not only do programmers usually agree to use a single or a few different languages, but the way they structure the code allows for quicker reading by others. 

Coding standards also allow developers to write better code. For instance, ESLint does not allow developers to use var for variables. Instead, it makes them use let or const, depending on whether or not the variable is ever changed in the code. This helps make the code more secure, and cleans up the code for others who may look at it later. 

However, sometimes it cam be difficult to read code. After all, if every chapter in a book was written in a completely different style, I would imagine that book would be pretty difficult to read. Having the book written in a consistent style makes it much easier to read and understand. Code is the same way. Having a consistent coding style enforced by codong standards makes code much easier to read and understand, and therefore makes it easier to write additional code when necessary. 

Coding standards must also be fairly easy to understand. They can be restrictive, but should be restrictive for the good of the user. Luckily, in the coding standard I am using at the moment, ESLint, it is a good coding standard which, while restrictive in some cases, makes coding a lot easier to both write and understand.
