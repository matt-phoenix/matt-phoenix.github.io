## Basics
Basic webpages are easy, especially with all of the tools around to help. You can just copy the code for a basic HTML file, input some text, and voila, you have created a webpage. Unfortunately for most UI developers, going beyond the basics is anything but easy. Single elements themselves are usually very simple as long as one remembers the syntax. For instance, forgetting that one has to put <li> inside of a ><ul>> element. However, nesting elements inside of other elements is also possible, and that is where HTML can get very complicated.

## Complications
Sure, list elements are simple, but what about putting links inside of them? Or images? Or linked images? Keeping track of all those elements can be very confusing and unfortunately, often creates a lot of syntax problems, up to the point where eyes start swimming as soon as they even look at the code for a webpage. Unfortunately, most webpages don't look good with just HTML. In order to make a webpage look good, some styling is necessary, which is where HTML comes in. 

## Adding CSS
Like HTML, CSS is relatively simple on its own. Changing the color of some text or the background color of a page isn't that difficult. It's just a few lines of code. It's when combining elements that things get hard. The scope of each change makes CSS difficult to use occassionally. A small change in one area can easily mess up another. In fact, formatting is one of the most difficult parts of CSS, because even adding a single line to an element can easily change the formatting of everything else if a programmer is not careful.

## Bootstrap
Fortunately, Bootstrap solves a lot of these problems. They implement a grid-based system, which allows a developer to focus a lot less on where elements are being placed and more on how to place them. Their classes are also very useful on different window sizes, and are often much easier to use than the equivalent CSS, saving a lot of time. However, Bootstrap is also very frustrating to use, perhaps occassionally more so than CSS. the presets are very helpful in styling a good webpage, but they are not very useful and sometimes even get in the way if a programmer wanted something outside of the presets, like using square buttons instead of rounded buttons. And spacing is soemtimes an issue if a programmer doesn't want the default settings.

Even though Bootstrap is a very powerful tool, it also has many weaknesses and is not very reliable if trying to work outside of it (say, recreating certain websites). It's foolish to try creating a website with Bootstrap alone, but it's a very useful framework for working with CSS.
