## Coding Standards

Rules are interesting. Often, they're arbitrarily set, like using x and y for variables and a and b for constants. They only work because they're agreed upon and consistently used. If we agreed upon it, they could easily be flipped. Other rules are set because they make sense, like having both a floor and ceiling for speed limits. Imagine the chaos if people who drove 10mph shared the road with people who drove 100mph. Coding is a mix of both. To make code more readable, we implemented a set of rules. Some are arbitrary, but others make sense, though not everyone agrees on what those rules should be, after all, they are usually arbitrary. However, coding standards should be implemented in every project. the main point of coding standards is consistency and readability. In ICS 314, we used ESLint, which enforced the proper usage of whitespace, which usually meant no more than one or two newlines between blocks of code. However, other coders use different coding standards, because what matters with these coding standards is that the rules are consistent so that they're easy to both write and read, and readable to make it easy for others to understand the code.
