## Coding Standards

Rules are interesting. Often, they're arbitrarily set, like using x and y for variables and a and b for constants. They only work because they're agreed upon and consistently used. If we agreed upon it, they could easily be flipped. Other rules are set because they make sense, like having both a floor and ceiling for speed limits. Imagine the chaos if people who drove 10mph shared the road with people who drove 100mph. Coding is a mix of both. To make code more readable, we implemented a set of rules. Some are arbitrary, but others make sense, though not everyone agrees on what those rules should be, after all, they are usually arbitrary. These sets of rules are often called coding standards, which allow programmers to communicate standards for how they write their code. However, coding standards should be implemented in every project. the main point of coding standards is consistency and readability. In ICS 314, we used ESLint, which enforced the proper usage of whitespace, which usually meant no more than one or two newlines between blocks of code. However, other coders use different coding standards, because what matters with these coding standards is that the rules are consistent so that they're easy to both write and read, and readable to make it easy for others to understand the code. 

## Open Source Software Development

Open source. Aren't those two words things we hear almost everywhere these days? A lot of programs these days are built on open-source software, not just web development. Open-source software is software that is generally freely available to use, almost all rights are granted to users, including modification, usage, and distribution. However, some open-source software reserve certain rights, such as the ability to release software modified from the original underneath a different license. In this course, I have used many different pieces of open-source software, all of which have made my life easier. However, the usage of open-source software stretches much farther beyond that, and it comes down to a simple principle repeated often. "Don't reinvent the wheel." That's why open-source software is so useful. Because the plans have been shared, we don't need to reinvent the wheel, we just need to take the idea and figure out how to apply it to our projects. Because there is so much open-source software on the market these days, I don't know what I'll be using in the future, but I do know that I will be using open-source software in many projects to come.
