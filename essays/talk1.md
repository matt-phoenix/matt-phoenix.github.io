## The talk
Today I attended a talk by Kevin Costa. At first I hardly had any expectations. Not because the experience wouldn't be valuable, but because beyond my classes, I have little to no information about programming. I've always heard that programming in the "real world" would be drastically different from programming in the university, so I was prepared to not understand anything that was being said. 

Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the information was easy to understand and not full of technical jargon, although I have learned that I should probably study some as the jargon that was said completely flew over my head. Even so, I understood a few things from the talk. 

## Lessons learned
First, the development process can be divided into many subsections. On large projects these subsections may belong to individual people, but other times they may have multiple parts belong to a single developer, although it is more common on medium sized and small projects. In fact, if only one person is working on a project, then they would have to take on the entire process by themselves. Even so, sometimes one person may take on a certain part during the process and later on switch to another, it just dependds on the project.

Also, certain languages are used in certain companies. In fact, dpeending on the company, multiple languages may be used and different programming interfaces. In order to become a good programmer, it may not be necessary (or even possible) to learn all of the separate interfaces, but it is necessary to be flexible and be willing to learn whatever you need to. 

## The end
Overall, it was an enjoyable and productive learning experience. Other people had very good questions! I approve of how at the end the place was opened up for questions, and how they were answered, even though some of them may have been difficult to answer.
