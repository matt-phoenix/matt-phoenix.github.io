## Learning Javascript
When I first started to learn Javascript, I was amazed. "The power of the sun within the keys of my keyboard," one could say. The power to create a variable without having to specify what variable it would be, and even further, to mix several different types of variables into one array. Coming from languages like C and Java, this was an amazing power. One that could solve many of my problems with object oriented programming.

But like any honeymoon phase, it was soon over, and my fear started to set in as I realized the potential ramifications of having such power. How would I know which variable was what type, and therefore which variables I could compare against each other? Typeof() provides some comfort in this regard, but not enough. I could see that I needed to be more careful with this language than I would with any that came before it. 

However, the journey with Javascript has been enjoyable so far. Learning the basics of the language has made me interested in discovering more, despite the twists and turns. Learning anything always comes with difficulties and frustrations, but what I've seen so far has made me decide that venturing down this path is a worthwhile step in my journey through life. And, well, being able to build my own website is a huge plus too.
