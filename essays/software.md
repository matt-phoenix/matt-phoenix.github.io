Ever since I was young, I've always wanted to create things. At first, it was the arts. Those little projects they have you do in kindergarten that make you look like you're about to become the next Picasso. Then, like any kid whose parents want them to grow up to be the next Mozart, it was music. I learned the piano, learned how to sing, and even how to make my own music, but unfortunately, I had no talent for it. I hardly had direction either, as back then I couldn't even name my favorite genre. Imagine that, a man growing up who couldn't even decide what their favorite music was. I had always had a passing interest in software because my father was a programmer. But although I knew where I wanted to go, I didn't know why I wanted to do it. Honestly, I'm still figuring that part out, even as I go through college. 

Fortunately, I recently learned more about software engineering, and it reignited some of my passion for the field. I am quite excited to learn more about the back-end development, although I understand that learning both sides is very important. Also, I hope to make some APIs of my own, so learning about how software is made is likely to be very important, although I don't know if I will be learning directly about API's anytime soon, which is slightly less fortunate.

What I hope to get out of software engineering in the future the most is the ability to create my own programs. I love the ability to customize things the way that I want them to. I also hope, eventually, that I am able to get a good paying job with a satisfactory work-life balance. Eventually, I hope to be able to gain enough confidence to work on open-source projects with hundreds of people and develop stuff that will help both developers and the average citizen.
