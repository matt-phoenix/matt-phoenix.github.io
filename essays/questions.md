People ask questions all the time. Why is the sky blue? Can I pet your dog? Is it a bird, a plane, or Superman? These questions are simple and typically easy to answer. In fact, a Google search will answer most questions posed by people, although more research is usually necessary to understand them. While teachers may say "There are no stupid questions" and this may be true in a classroom setting, where people should be asking questions, it is usually less true online, where Google searches are abundant and clear and concise information is everywhere. In fact, if an answer can be obtained through a quick Google search, it is typically considered a stupid question. However, on the flip side, if a user has already done a Google search and cannot understand the answer, then it may be considered to be a better question. In this way, there are good questions and bad questions. Good questions tend to be questions that show that the asker has done their homework and specific about the details, while bad questions tend to be ones that do not show that the asker has done their homework and are very unspecific about the details.

## Smart Questions
Stack Overflow is a site for people to ask questions and get answers. However, not every question is always good, and often, bad questions get ignored or even downvoted. On the contrary, good questions often get many quality answers.
