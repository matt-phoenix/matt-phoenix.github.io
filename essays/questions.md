People ask questions all the time. Why is the sky blue? Can I pet your dog? Is it a bird, a plane, or Superman? These questions are simple and typically easy to answer. In fact, a Google search will answer most questions posed by people, although more research is usually necessary to understand them. While teachers may say "There are no stupid questions" and this may be true in a classroom setting, where people should be asking questions, it is usually less true online, where Google searches are abundant and clear and concise information is everywhere.
