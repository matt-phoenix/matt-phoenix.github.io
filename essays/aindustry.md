## Introduction

AI is an incredibly powerful tool in many fields. In education, it can give answers to questions that students may not know, or even give assistance in writing essays. In Software Engineering, it is still a potent tool, but sadly detrimental in many ways. I mainly used two AI tools throughout the semester, ChatGPT and Github Copilot. 

## Personal Experience With AI

My personal experience was that AI was useful, but only in particular applications that essentially boiled down into grunt work. The AI often turned my code into a chore in which I had to manually check everything that it was doing instead of writing code, both of which in my mind took almost the same time.

### Experience WODs
I had used ChatGPT at first when the WODs were relatively simple, but as they became more difficult, the AI would come up with incorrect answers almost all the time. The logic itself was solid and could be easily followed, but there were many bugs in the code itself. Since the WODs were timed, and there were videos we could watch afterward, it became a detrimental source of learning.

### In-Class Practice WODs

Using ChatGPT was often a waste of time compared to just doing the WOD normally. Copilot was more helpful, however, it would often give incomplete answers and cause bugs in the code that then had to be searched for, wasting time, so it was relegated to figuring out repetitive tasks rather than doing anything important. In fact, I often used its autocomplete to act as a guide rather than a complete piece of code.

### In-Class WODs

I used ChatGPT at the start to explain concepts that I didn't understand, also used it once to write code then found out that code was pretty broken and never used it again for that purpose. I still used Copilot for redundant code pieces though. 

### Essays

I haven't used any AI at all for essays because I don't believe an AI can answer for me. (Though I was tempted to use it for this essay)

### Final Project

I have used Copilot to write redundant code over and over as there was a lot of that in this project, but not for anything else.

### Learning a Concept / Tutorial

AI, like many sources on the internet, cannot be trusted to give factual information. If, like Wikipedia, it gave sources from where it got the information, it might be useful because then we could go to the source, but it doesn't. Books and tutorials on YouTube are often better sources of information than using AI.

### Answering a Question in Class or in Discord

While trying to find answers to questions in class I came across answers that usually sounded wrong somehow, but didn't have the knowledge to dispute it. AI was never even used for Discord because of the necessity to get answers right, or else risk leading people down the wrong path.

### Asking or Answering a Smart-Question

I didn't even think about using AI for this, for the same reason above. When answering a question, people need accurate information, and AI cannot guarantee that.

### Coding Example

I only used official documentation for coding examples because the idea of using AI for this never came to me.

### Explaining Code

I never used AI for this purpose because it didn't come across as an idea. 

### Documenting Code

When it came to most in-class projects there wasn't enough time to document, so using AI to document code was out of the question. However, it may be good as a starting point for the final project. 

### Quality Assurance

I found that when using Copilot it would often produce errors which I had to fix, and so I didn't use it to also fix those errors. I also felt that I would learn more by fixing them myself.

### Other Uses in ICS 314 Not Listed

I cannot recall any other uses which have not been documented previously.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI was overall a negative mark in my learning, as it was useful in the beginning, but when the concepts were complicated enough that I had to study to understand them, AI often came up with incorrect answers or broken answers, such as code, in which I would have to spend almost the same amount of time that I would have writing the code as debugging it. It also didn't help with understanding those concepts.

## Practical Application

Practical Applications do exist, as evidenced by the wealth of AI being used around the world for everything, including identifying cancer cells, but those things are often AI with very limited scopes, while ChatGPT tries to answer almost everything, and does a very good job for general questions, but when it comes down to specific knowledge it often fails. Copilot is better in that regard, but it still doesn't do well when adding packages of code and trying to figure out the syntax of those packages. 

## Challenges and Opportunites

There were many challenges with using AI. It would often give incomplete answers, such as a semicolon missing somewhere or a string not completed. Other times it would give wrong answers, or go a completely different route of thinking than expected, which led to time spent figuring out what it meant. In order to improve, the AI needs more data, from all different types of programming in order to be useful, because it often misses out on simple syntax that it should have noticed.

## Comparative Analysis

If having to choose between traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches, traditional teaching methods are far superior. AI is not reliable enough to use efficiently. It cannot be argued against by someone without knowledge. However, the possibility of a teacher using it to draft up a lesson plan is practical, because a teacher would know when the AI gets things wrong and is able to correct them. However, teachers cannot rely on AI fully, which is a dangerous possibility if not guarded against.

## Future Considerations

As we have seen with the advancement of AI in the art sector, AI in the software engineering sector will likely improve considerably. However, unlike art, which can often be "good enough" for most people, software engineering demands better error statistics. if an AI writes a whole program and misses 3 semicolons, then the entire build will fail. While humans can correct the errors, in order for AI to be very efficient, it needs to reduce the errors as much as possible, which could possibly be solved by having a larger data set. After all, debugging takes up a lot of time, so it's better if the code works straight out of the box.

## Conclusions

AI in its current state is not good for learning. However, even considering that, it is important that future programmers get their hands on this tool now, if only to learn how to use it properly. Teachers should also learn how to use it to be able to teach students how to use it, because AI has been seen to improve considerably in just a few years, and has the possibility of becoming a large part of a programmer's job in the future. But at this point, AI should not be a tool for learning, only for learning about, because it has a nontrivial possibility of hurting a student's learning.
