## Introduction

AI is an incredibly powerful tool in many fields. In education, it can give answers to questions that students may not know, or even give assistance in writing esssays. In Software Engineering, it is still a potent tool, but sadly detrimental in many ways. I mainly used two AI tools throughout the semester, ChatGPT and Github Copilot.

The AI often turned my code into a chore in which I had to manually check everything that it was doing instead of writing code, both of which in my mind took almost the same time.
