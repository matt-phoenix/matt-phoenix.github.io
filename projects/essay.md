## Starting the project
Going in, I have to admit I had no idea what I was doing. But I was eager to learn, so I did a lot of research for this project, looking over tons of data. We were able to choose the subject of our paper, so I chose the United Kingdom. Throughout my research about the paper, I learned many things, including which sources were credible and which to take as opinions rather than factual news.
