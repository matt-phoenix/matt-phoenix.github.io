## Starting the project
Going in, I have to admit I had no idea what I was doing. But I was eager to learn, so I did a lot of research for this project, looking over tons of data. We were able to choose the subject of our paper, so I chose the United Kingdom. Throughout my research about the paper, I learned many things, including which sources were credible and which to take as opinions rather than factual news. 

## In the middle
When I started writing, I immediately hit a wall. Words wouldn't flow. I had to learn how to manage my time in the face of writer's block. Luckily I was able to get help from my teacher and he was able to give me some tips to improve my paper. Thankfully I didn't give up, or else my grades would look very different right now.

## Finishing the project
As most students do when finishing projects, I felt a sense of relief. But even so, it was a difficult journey to get through. But I did it, and I learned a lot about how to manage time and how to make myself complete a hard task from start to end. I'm sure that I'll learn even more lessons from the next difficult project as well.
