The reason Daytime Ballroom Dancing was started is because people wanted a time to dance and a place to do it, and also to do it with others who also enjoyed dancing.

At the start I just learned how to set the whole event up, but as time went on I was basically in charge of everything, from set up to break down. 

I learned a lot, including how to set up the speakers so that the echo was reduced as much as possible, and also how to play the music from them.
