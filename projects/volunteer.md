The reason Daytime Ballroom Dancing was started is because people wanted a time to dance and a place to do it, and also to do it with others who also enjoyed dancing. I was not the leader of this event, but as a volunteer, I needed to do many things, such as setting up the audio equipment and becoming the DJ for the event. I also helped with tearing down the event afterward and helping to solve problems with the equipment.
